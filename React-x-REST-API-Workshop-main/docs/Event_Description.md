# JavaScript Workshop - Build a React App Using Web Database

Let's create a front-end React Component that exchanges the contents of a 3rd party Web Database service using Express as a proxy.

## ABOUT THIS EVENT

In this 2 hour workshop, you'll walk away with a React project that retrieves data from and uploads data to Kintone, a web database service.

We'll walk you through the basics of REST API calls and CORS, usage of State and Effect Hooks, setting up an Express back-end, and using it as a proxy.
