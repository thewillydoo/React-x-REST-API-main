## Got Questions? ü§î
Feel free to msg me with a workshop-related or a general Kintone question to me anytime ~

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

## Why use Kintone?
+ Super easy to use database / backend solution
+ You can use vanilla JS to build customizations right on the platform
+ Companies are hiring engineers to build Kintone integrations

More information:
+ Get Hacking with Kintone - https://kintone.dev/en/landing-page/hackathon/
+ Job Listing - Kintone Developer Forum - https://forum.kintone.dev/t/seeking-independent-contractors-with-kintone-customization-programming-skills/550

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

## Start the servers

Open two terminal windows

From the project root directory, run:
npm run start

From the backend directory, run:
npm run start

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

## Where to get the Subdomain, View ID, and App ID?

Go to your Kintone App's custom view & grab the URL
Kintone App's URL follows this template:
https://<SUBDOMAIN>.kintone.com/k/<App ID>/
Example:

https://example.kintone.com/k/1/
Subdomain = example
KINTONE_BASE_URL = https://example.kintone.com
App ID = 1

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

If you get lost, you can "rewind" on our lives stream on YouTube:
https://youtu.be/O6FnSGgGBRk

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

Direct Message with your email address if you forgot your Kintone Subdomain

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =

The KINTONE_BASE_URL variable is based on your subdomain.

For example:
Subdomain = example
KINTONE_BASE_URL = https://example.kintone.com

=   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =   =
